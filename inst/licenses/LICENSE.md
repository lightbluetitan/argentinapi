   The API is publicly accessible, does not require authentication, and is intended for educational and analytical purposes.

2. **REST Countries API**  
   An open-source project that offers information about countries worldwide, including demographics, geography, and regional groupings.  
   This API is also publicly accessible and does not require authentication.
